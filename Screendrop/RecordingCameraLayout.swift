//  Camera layouts: how the screen card and the camera share the canvas.
//  A project has a default layout and any number of layout cues on the
//  timeline. Each layout resolves to a frame (where the screen card and
//  the camera sit, their corners and opacities) and the timeline morphs
//  from one frame to the next at every cue boundary, so the camera can
//  fill the canvas for an intro and then shrink into its corner when the
//  screen takes over. Preview and export resolve the same frames.
